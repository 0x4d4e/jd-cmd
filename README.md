# jd-cmd

jd-cmd is a thin-wrapper for the [Java Decompiler](http://java.decompiler.free.fr/).

This is a hack around the IntelliJ IDE plugin. It fakes the interfaces of the
IDE, and provides access to JD-Core.

This was originally [jd-core-java](https://github.com/nviennot/jd-core-java) 
and [JDCommandLine](https://github.com/betterphp/JDCommandLine)

## Supported Platforms

jd-cmd supports:

* Linux 32/64-bit
* Windows 32/64-bit
* Mac OSX 32/64-bit on x86 hardware

### Requirements

(Java)[http://java.com/en/download/] runtime is required, at least version 6 is needed but we suggest usage of Java 7. Native libraries (at least the Linux ones) crashes occasionally with Java 6.

## Usage


### Command line

	// TODO


### Programmatically

	//TODO - API is changing now
